# Maximum-path-sum
Find maximum path in an integer-pyramid, using recursion.
Example: 
              [4]
             [5,7]
            [3,4,2]
           [8,3,6,1]
is an integer-pyramid with the maximum path: 4->7->4->6 and its sum is: 21.

# Maximum-path-sum-mem
same problem, but with memoization.

# Motivation
Implementation of recursive functions.

The pyramid.txt file is the pyramid from problem 18 of Project Euler: https://projecteuler.net/problem=18
